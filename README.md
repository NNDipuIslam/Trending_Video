The Flutter video app offers seamless video streaming with a user-friendly interface. Features include a video listing page with details like title and views, a dedicated playback page showing video and channel info (name, image, subscribers), and a comments section displaying only the latest comment. Developed with Flutter for a responsive, cross-platform experience. Features are:

1. Video Listing Page:
Thumbnails of videos retrieved from an API.
Information such as title, views, and upload time is displayed for each video.

2. Video Playback Page:
Clicking on a thumbnail opens a new page where the selected video can be played.
Information like title, views, and upload time is still visible on this page.

3. Channel Information:
Display the channel name, image, and the number of subscribers on the video playback page.
This information can be fetched from the same API or a different API endpoint that provides details about the channel.

3. Comments Section:
Users can leave comments on the video page.
Only the latest comment is displayed to the users.
